        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Protein pancakes made from oat flour and a blend of whey and casein protein for a high protein breakfast option. You can prep the dry 
            ingredients in advanced and have these ready to go quickly each morning. </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
           <ul>
            <li>50/50 whey/casein blend 25g total</li>
            <li>oat flour 20g</li>
            <li>cornstarch 10g</li>
            <li>baking powder 1g</li>
            <li>egg whites 60g</li>
            <li>greek yogurt 75g</li>
            <li>water 25ml</li>
                   </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Mix all the dry ingredients together so no clumps are present. NOTE: I have tested this with only whey protein and it doesn't turn out as well. Only casein will work 
                but you may need more water in the batter. The 50/50 blend is best.</li>
            <li>Add in the wet ingredients and mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Heat a griddle/skillet on medium heat and spray with oil. 
                Add the batter and cook for a couple minutes, then flip. </li>
        </ol>
