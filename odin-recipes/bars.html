        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Oats, nuts, milk and honey</strong> â€“ what could be more natural? Some people have trouble 
            putting on weight of any kind and these bulking bars are just the ticket.  
            These nutritious bars are also great for people doing physical jobs or students 
            who need to keep a quick meal in their pockets.  These nutrient dense bars quickly
             give you the protein blast you need along with good fats and complex carbs for 
             lasting energy. Not only do they taste as good as candy bars but they are healthy
             , natural, and high in protein as well. Even better, you can make these at home 
             in five minutes WITHOUT cooking for 1/10 the cost of pre-made protein bars and 
             weight gain products.</p>
